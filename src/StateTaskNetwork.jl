State task networks were originally developed for sequencing (high-level) and scheduling (low-level) problems for batch operations.
Batch operations means batches of material may be merged, or split, along workflows to produce various products.

I follow these references:

The STN has 2 types of nodes, *state* nodes represent initial, intermediate, and final products.
*Task* nodes represent the processing operations which transform input products to output products.
It looks like a Petri net, but it appears the original authors were not aware of them.
Coincidentally, S and T even mirror the "state" and "transition" language of PNs.
